# OOP Project
This system is designed to manage the day-to-day operations and processes of a Laundromat. The database schema of the system consists of different tables such as Student, customer, washplan, washorder, and billing. Each of these tables holds relevant information that is required for Laundromat operations.

The system provides an interface that allows you to manage and view the data efficiently. One can access and update student information, schedule wash order and generate bills (using functions/procedures and triggers). The system provides a view feature that allows user to quickly find student data, Washplans, pending and older washes and customer information.
